## SHOOTING GALLERY

One of Burlington Bytes' contract developers has suddenly disappeared in a puff of smoke and we've decided to place a bounty on the completion of an important project they had just begun working on before their abrupt sublimation.

The project was to develop a plugin for WordPress that would allow anybody editing posts in the wp-admin dashboard to easily add a slideshow of images to the post that they're working on.
After reviewing the needs of the client's content editing team, it was decided that they would like to see an additional metabox on the post/page editing screen, called "Slideshow Gallery Images", that will allow users to select images to add to a slideshow. The slideshow would then be output above the post automatically, if there are any images attached to the post via this metabox. (Not all posts will display a slideshow)

The content team also expressed that in some cases they would like the slideshow to appear in the middle of, or the end of the post, and wondered if there were other solutions we could use to let the post author indicate exactly where they wanted the slideshow to appear in the post.  Regardless, we'd like the slideshow to appear automatically at the top UNLESS they indicated a different position for the slideshow to appear.

Some technical details from the previous developers' notes included their preference for using the Owl Carousel library to render the slideshow on the front-end of the site, the Featherlight lightbox library to view a larger version of images, and they left behind some stock code to make it easier to select images from the wordpress media gallery (they noted that this was a difficult thing to create, but that the stock code also makes some assumptions that may limit the choices for functionality).

Fortunately, before their unexpected disincorporation, the developer was also able to produce a fairly robust skeleton of the framework they expected to have when the project was complete, and you're welcome to begin your work from where they left off.  Since the event occurred right in the middle of the day, and we committed their code post-disappearance, nothing should be assumed to be tested and bug-free. At the end of the day, however, implementation choices can't be made by vaporous humors, so it's up to you whether you want to use these tools, or forge your own way.

Burlington Bytes welcomes your interest in assisting us with this project, and will be happy to answer any questions you may have about our expectations for this project by contacting us via twitter @burlingtonbytes #codechallenge (yeah, you only get 108 characters to work with) - however please understand that we cannot assist you with any specific questions about your implementation choices. If this project is what caused our previous developer to vanish, we simply cannot risk allowing any more of our developers to vaporize inexplicably in this way. We sincerely hope this does not happen to you, but can make no guarantees.

Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
