### Thoughts and process

I had to rush this a bit as my evenings this week were mostly hijacked by an angry sick baby.  This led to me making
some design changes that I may not have if I had had a leisurely amount if time for this.  Mostly it led to me deciding 
to use ACF Pro for meta boxes and image selection.  I didn't feel like browsing through an admittedly limiting image 
uploader was a good use of my time when wordpress provides one that works really well and the ACF interface for adding 
images is super simple.

Because this is an internal plugin I didn't include ACF as a library, which would be necessary if you were planning on 
selling this plugin.  I did include the ACF Pro plugin in the resources dir just in case you don't happen to have it.

# Burlington Bytes Challenge Project

Completed Entries should be zipped and submitted via the form at http://www.burlingtonbytes.com/code-challenge, along 
with a link to your public repository.  More information and official rules can also be found at that address.

## SHOOTING GALLERY

One of Burlington Bytes' contract developers has suddenly disappeared in a puff of smoke and we've decided to place a 
bounty on the completion of an important project they had just begun working on before their abrupt sublimation.

The project was to develop a plugin for WordPress that would allow anybody editing posts in the wp-admin dashboard to 
easily add a slideshow of images to the post that they're working on.
After reviewing the needs of the client's content editing team, it was decided that they would like to see an additional 
metabox on the post/page editing screen, called "Slideshow Gallery Images", that will allow users to select images to 
add to a slideshow. The slideshow would then be output above the post automatically, if there are any images attached 
to the post via this metabox. (Not all posts will display a slideshow)

The content team also expressed that in some cases they would like the slideshow to appear in the middle of, or the end 
of the post, and wondered if there were other solutions we could use to let the post author indicate exactly where they 
wanted the slideshow to appear in the post.  Regardless, we'd like the slideshow to appear automatically at the top 
UNLESS they indicated a different position for the slideshow to appear.

Some technical details from the previous developers' notes included their preference for using the Owl Carousel library 
to render the slideshow on the front-end of the site, the Featherlight lightbox library to view a larger version of 
images, and they left behind some stock code to make it easier to select images from the wordpress media gallery (they 
noted that this was a difficult thing to create, but that the stock code also makes some assumptions that may limit the 
choices for functionality).

Fortunately, before their unexpected disincorporation, the developer was also able to produce a fairly robust skeleton 
of the framework they expected to have when the project was complete, and you're welcome to begin your work from where 
they left off.  Since the event occurred right in the middle of the day, and we committed their code post-disappearance, 
nothing should be assumed to be tested and bug-free. At the end of the day, however, implementation choices can't be made 
by vaporous humors, so it's up to you whether you want to use these tools, or forge your own way.

Burlington Bytes welcomes your interest in assisting us with this project, and will be happy to answer any questions you 
may have about our expectations for this project by contacting us via twitter @burlingtonbytes #codechallenge (yeah, you 
only get 108 characters to work with) - however please understand that we cannot assist you with any specific questions 
about your implementation choices. If this project is what caused our previous developer to vanish, we simply cannot risk 
allowing any more of our developers to vaporize inexplicably in this way. We sincerely hope this does not happen to you, 
but can make no guarantees.

Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
